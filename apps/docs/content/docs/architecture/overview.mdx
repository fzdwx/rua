# Architecture Overview

Rua is built with a modern, modular architecture that prioritizes performance, extensibility, and maintainability.

## High-Level Architecture

Rua follows a layered architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

**User Interface Layer:**
- React Frontend - Modern React-based user interface
- Theme System - Customizable theming and styling
- UI Components - Reusable interface components

**Application Layer:**
- Rua Core - Central application logic and coordination
- Extension Manager - Handles extension lifecycle and communication
- Search Engine - Provides fast, fuzzy search capabilities
- Configuration - Manages application and user settings

**System Layer:**
- Tauri Runtime - Cross-platform application framework
- File System - Secure file system access
- Process Manager - System process interaction
- Clipboard API - System clipboard integration

**Extension Layer:**
- Extensions - Third-party functionality extensions
- Extension API - Secure API for extension development

## Technology Stack

### Frontend Stack

**Core Technologies:**
- React 19 - UI framework with concurrent features
- TypeScript - Type safety and developer experience
- Vite - Fast build tool and development server
- Tailwind CSS - Utility-first CSS framework

### Backend Stack

**Runtime Technologies:**
- Tauri 2.0 - Desktop application framework
- Rust - Systems programming language

# ruactl

ruactl is the command-line tool for controlling Rua. It's required to toggle the Rua window.

## Installation

Download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/fzdwx/rua/releases):

```bash
wget https://github.com/fzdwx/rua/releases/latest/download/ruactl-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
tar -xzf ruactl-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
mv ruactl ~/.local/bin/
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/ruactl
```

Add to PATH in `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Or build from source:

```bash
# From the rua repository
./install-ruactl.sh          # Install to ~/.local/bin
just install                  # Install to /usr/bin (requires sudo)
```

## Commands

### toggle

Toggle Rua window visibility:

```bash
ruactl toggle
```

### health

Check if Rua is running:

```bash
ruactl health
```

### validate

Validate an extension manifest:

```bash
ruactl validate              # Current directory
ruactl validate ./my-ext     # Specific directory
```

### pack

Package an extension for distribution:

```bash
ruactl pack                  # Current directory
ruactl pack ./my-ext         # Specific directory
ruactl pack --dry-run        # Preview without creating archive
```

## Window Manager Integration

### Hyprland

```bash
# ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf
bind = ALT, Space, exec, ruactl toggle
```

### i3 / Sway

```bash
bindsym $mod+space exec ruactl toggle
```

### GNOME

Settings → Keyboard → Custom Shortcuts:
- Command: `ruactl toggle`
- Shortcut: Your preference

### KDE

System Settings → Shortcuts → Custom Shortcuts:

## How It Works

Rua runs an HTTP server on `127.0.0.1:7777`. ruactl sends requests to this server to control the window.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection refused

Rua must be running first:

```bash
rua              # Start Rua
ruactl health    # Should succeed now
```

### Command not found

Check PATH:

```bash
echo $PATH | grep ".local/bin"
# If missing, add to ~/.bashrc:
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```
